#whack-a-mole

A whack-a-mole game that gets progressively harder. This game was a university project. It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You can play it just by opening the html file. The project was originally made for a functional programming class but there wasn't a strict requirement for functional programming style for this project, therefore it's in a mixed style.

The goal of the game is to click on the white cricle as many times as possible while avoiding the click on the red ones.
